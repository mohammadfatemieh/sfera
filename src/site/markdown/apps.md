# Apps

Apps are Java applications distributed as .jar files. To install an app, just drop the corresponding .jar file in the `plugins` directory.

They extend Sfera's core functionalities in many possible ways, for instance:

* providing vertical solutions (e.g. an access control application)
* providing a user interface to Sfera (e.g. the Web app)
* extending other apps
* implementing a custom control logic for specific drivers
* ...
