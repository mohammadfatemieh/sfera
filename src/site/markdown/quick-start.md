# Quick start

If you can't wait to try Sfera, here is how to get a ready-to-use installation that includes the [Web App](../apps/cc.sferalabs.sfera.apps.webapp/latest), some drivers and some example control logic:

    ~ $ bash <(curl -s http://sfera.sferalabs.cc/setup/install.sh)
    ~ $ cd sfera
    ~/sfera $ sudo java -jar sfera.jar

If you're running into problems, ensure you have all the [requirements installed](installation.html).
    
Now you can access the Web App wIDE at 'http://localhost:8080/wide/' and two sample interfaces at 'http://localhost:8080/big/' (desktop/tablet interface) and 'http://localhost:8080/small/' (mobile interface) using the credentials:

Username: `admin`   
Password: `admin`
