# Drivers

Drivers are extensions that enable Sfera to communicate with a specific field system.
They are distributed as Sfera plugins, which are simply .jar files and can be installed by dropping them in the `plugins` directory.

The driver documentation is embedded into its JavaDoc. The overview page contains all the configuration parameters, including the `type` parameter, which specifies the class that is implemented by the driver instances.

From the JavaDoc of the type-class you can see all the public methods available on the driver node which are callable from scripts and Java code.

Most drivers have an `events` sub-package containing the classes of the events generated by the driver. Refer to their JavaDoc for details on the events, such as their IDs and possible values.

[Here](../drivers/) you can find all the available drivers.
